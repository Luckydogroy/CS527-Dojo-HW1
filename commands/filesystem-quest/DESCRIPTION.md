With your knowledge of `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`, we're ready to play a little game!

We'll start it out in `/`.
Normally:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ cd /
hacker@dojo:/$ ls
bin   challenge  etc   home  lib32  libx32  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
boot  dev        flag  lib   lib64  media   opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
```

That's a lot of contents!
One day, you will be quite familiar with them, but already, you might recognize the `flag` file and the `challenge` directory.

In this challenge, I have *hidden the flag*!
Here, you will use `ls` and `cat` to follow my breadcrumbs and find it!
Here's how it'll work:

0. Your first clue is in `/`. Head on over there.
1. Look around with `ls`. There'll be a file named HINT or CLUE or something along those lines!
2. `cat` that file to read the clue!
3. Depending on what the clue says, head on over to the next directory (or don't!).
4. Follow the clues to the flag!

Good luck!
