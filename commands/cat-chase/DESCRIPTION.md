You can specify all sorts of paths as arguments to commands, and we'll practice some more with `cat`.
In this level, I'll put the flag in some crazy directory, and I will not allow you to change directories with `cd`, so no `cat flag` for you.
You must retrieve the flag by absolute path, wherever it is.
